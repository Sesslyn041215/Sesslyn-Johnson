  She works as a<i> intern in freshworks</i>. In my family, I was the second baby girl.
  My parents, however , excepted a baby boy.But my mom accepted whole heartly as a gift from God. 
  My father wasn't very pleased , so he hasn't come looking for me in nearly a month.
  After that, my father came to show my aunt the way, as she visited the newborn baby.
  My father was very strict. If I and my sister made any mistakes, he will punish us severly which started creating misunderstand between us.
  My father and I will never really understand one another. It will get worse if I try to solve it. 
  I stopped communicating to my father as much possible.But I was too close for my mom, I'll share everything with my mom.
  I always been a mommy's girl who finds it difficult to communicate with others and who is the polar opposite of my sis
 </p>

  My mom is a teacher,as I mentioned earlier. My mom and my teachers are therefore close. 
  My mom gave me academic guidance. I did quite well in my school with the assistance of God. 
  However,I was enrolled in a basic school that only had fourth grade. 
  My sister was therefore given greater attention by my teachers beacuse she be leaving school early.
  As a result, I was bad at extracurricular activities, as I didn't take part in competition.
  I was always compared with my sister by my relatives and they used to level tapping me.But my mom supported and prayed for me to shine like a star.
  Nevertheless, things changed. My parents switched my school when I was in second grade due to a number of factors.
  After that, I managed to conquer my stage fright and I began taking part in  numerous debut , essay writing contests and fashion show competitions,
  which helped me gain confidence.I and my sister started to shine brightly in our new school as a result of my mother's prayer.  
  I placed third in district  on the <b> English Proficiency Test</b> in my fifth grade. I also suffered due to Typoid fever in the same year.
  I went through a lot of pain. 
 </p>

  After two year, My mom was offered with a government job as a teacher which depends on <b>TDTA diocese</b>.
  Without knowing the consequences, My mom joined in the job, which made us to suffer till the date.
  My mom haven't received her salary for the past 6 years.
  When I was studying 9th grade,my father lost his job as an ambulance driver which is an unexpected flood for my family.
  In 2019, I entered 10th std and worked incredibly hard to achieve best mark. But by 2020, Covid has spread throughout the entire earth. 
  So The <b>TN government </b>cancelled the board exam, it was a huge setback for my academic career.

  I'm hoping my school will sponser my future studies if I get decent grades.
  Because of Covid, the sponsership was terminated and my parents transferred me to a government school with low fees.
  I, however, did not agree with my parents' choice. My 11th grade is put on lockdown. Thus, I was too thrilled.
  However, in September 2021, the government announced plans to reopen schools, particularly for the 12th grade. 
  I was overly anxious and concerned about how I would do in school.
  My class teacher tortured me in a number of situations since I believed he was a bad teacher, which led to my depression.
  In many circumstances, I considered suiccide since I was unable to get out of my situation.He made me to hate every teachers.
  I began to worry excessively, which also had an impact on my health. I began threatening to kill myself and blackmailing my parents. 
  If my parents visited me in my school , I will start crying like a baby and I beg to change my school.
  My family was likewise concerned for me and advised me a lot<br> <b><em style="background-color:white; color:#009688;">"When you go through deep waters, I will be with you.
  When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown.When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up;
  the flames will not come you".-Isaiah 43:2 </b></em></br>
  My parents consoled me with this word on everyday.With the help of God, I started working hard and secured school third with <b>95%.</b>

 <p>
  I wish to pursue my college education at a reputable institution in Chennai.
  My dad doesn't have enough money to pay for my college feees. This led me to worry about my future.
  At that time, I took an exam for a service-based company at the time and got selected. It increased my desire towards IT sector.
  However, I've continued to apply for some major companies as well. Many people warned me I wouldn't be able to acquire a job at a renowned IT firm,
  so I forced me to work as hard as I could. In that company, I was chosen as well.
